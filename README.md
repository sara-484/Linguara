# Linguara

🌐 Linguara — A Language-Lover’s Frontend Playground

Welcome to Linguara, a handcrafted language-learning website built entirely with frontend technologies.
It began as a simple personal exercise—but quickly grew into a full project with much bigger goals.

👩‍💻 About the Creator

Made by Sara, a 15-year-old self-taught developer from Iran.
With no classes, no mentors, and no team, Linguara was born from late-night curiosity and a desire to build something meaningful.

> “Linguara isn’t just a site. It’s my voice as a language learner—turned into HTML.” — Sara

✨ Project Overview

🌱 Started as a frontend revision project

🌀 Evolved into a multi-page educational platform

🎯 Designed with the learner’s experience in mind


🔤 Why "Linguara"?

A blend of “Language” and “Sara” — a personal tribute to learning and creativity.
Styled with a soft palette of turquoise and lilac, the creator’s favorite colors.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with pure frontend tools:

🧱 HTML5 — Modular structure (5+ pages)

🎨 CSS3 — 10+ themed stylesheets

⚙️ Vanilla JS — For interactivity and logic

📄 JSON — Static content loading


> ⚠️ No backend or database (yet).
The content is minimal by design and will expand as the creator learns more.




---

⏳ Development & Timeline

Built in just 2 weeks

Modular file structure, with help from AI as a creative partner


> AI didn’t replace thinking — Sara acted as the architect, guiding the build with intention.

📌 Limitations

❌ No authentication, backend, or dynamic data

📉 Limited content (for now)

⚒️ Fully vanilla on purpose — to master the basics before using frameworks
---

🚀 What’s Next?

Add backend and expand content

Possibly rebuild with React or other tools

Introduce smarter learning features

Publish a companion article: “How I Learned Web Development at 13 — and Where I Am Now”

💬 Final Note

Linguara isn’t polished, and it’s not finished.
But it’s honest — a project born from curiosity, creativity, and self-learning.
It’s the beginning of a journey, not the end.
